# Turing machine interpreter

### Description
This is a turing machine interpreter I built after learning about Turing machines at school. It was mainly a challenge to get to know C and build my first project in it.

It uses a command line interface to show the machines' progress as it cycles through the states. The Touring machine instructions are encoded in a txt file as quintuples inside round brackets and separated by commas. Inside the curly brackets there are a few options that can be customized, such as the input string, the delay, the order of the elements in the quintuples to accomodate differences in notation, and also trailing lambdas can be enabled or disabled.
 

### Things to do
- Add options: 
    - initial pos
    - custom lambda value
- Restart option at the end of program
- Time taken and number of steps
